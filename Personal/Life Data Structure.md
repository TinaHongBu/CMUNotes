# What Data Structure Your Life Is

Is your life a LinkedList that are connected by random parts in different places,

Or is your life an ArrayList that is impossible to remove anything without leaving a inside hole.

Is your life a Stack that cannot make people stay,

Or is your life a Binary Tree that sees a lot of dead ends but still tries to grow.



The analogy stops here because that's all the data structures I know,

Before I got my memory overflow.
