# Summer Semester at CMU

My program is one of the few programs at CMU that requires students to be at campus taking classes and doing projects in the summer. Although I lost the chance of doing an internship, I personallly find this summer also rewarding as I learned a new language - Node.js (and automatically a little JavaScript), I learned to use AWS and got my account hacked and spent $3000 on it, I finished my 7-month capstone project and made meaningful connections with my customer, mentor, and external advisor, I started to go to the workout classes and formed regular workout habit, and I also learned several new dishes and had a lot of fun cooking for my boyfriend. 

I would like to make a summary of things I did this summer and resources available. Hope you find it helpful.

## Courses

### 1. Engineering Data Intensive Scalable Systems - 17-648

This class guides you through building an e-commerce backend system that handles session management using cookies, fast keyword search using full-text indexing or elasticsearch, and achieves scalability and availability by deploying Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling Groups on AWS . It's a good introductory course if you want to practice using Node.js, database performance optimization and AWS basics. 

One downside of this course is the professor is sometimes too chill. We only have class once a week or 2 weeks and other than that, we were given some videos and readings. Although there are quizzes to make sure you really did those things, at the end you found yourself to just be ctrl + f stuff. So I feel my knowledge foundation is not very solid.

Also you don't get a lot of help from the TA as the TA is not directly involved in neither the homework nor the autograder design. So no matter how much he is willing to help, it can be off the context sometimes. 

If you want to take this class, I would recommend you to take some Node.js & AWS courses on Lynda if you are not familiar with them. Lynda is a free resource for CMU students. For me, I didn't know anything about Node or backend development or NoSQL or ElasticSearch, and it took me around 10 hours per week to both learn enough backgound knowledge and to finish the homework.

### 2. Database Management - 95-703 

This is a introductory database class which covers ER models, normal forms, relational algebra, and basic Oracle SQL together with some analytics functions. I spent around 7 hours per week on it. The first half of the class covers the concepts that are very helpful  if you haven't taken a database class. But after we started to learn about SQL, the class gets much slower and less interesting. I feel like those functions don't need to be introduced one by one in detail from input, output to corner cases. Instead, what could be added is performance optimization, indexing, difference between Oracle database, MySQL, PostgreSQL and NoSQL and when to use each of them. 

### 3. Other Choises

- 15213/15513: Computer Systems, probably the most famous course at CMU. 
- Devops: I heard from friends it is helpful for developers.
- Professional Speaking
- Negotiation
- Economics for Engineers: My friend took it in the hope of learning some basic economics and finance concepts. But he said it's kind of boring. 

## Capstone Project

Our program, together with our sister programs MSE, MITS - SE, and MITS - ESE, all have 2 to 3 semester of capstone project that intends to mimic a industry project in a professional setting as a substitute for internships. My program, MITS, has 6 credits of project prep in the spring and 24 credits in the summer. Team members will take turns to be the project manager and practice planning, communication, and leadership skills. 

Our client is a research professor, Scott Fahlman at CMU which makes our project's nature more like a research project other than to build a commercial product. He is also the inventor of the smiley face. Super cool. A holdback for this capstone is that everyone in my program has to do a security related project while most of us are looking for SE or data jobs. However, doing a project with 3 other teammates, with a customer, a mentor, a external advisor for 7 months is something I've never done before as a new undergrad. And I learned a lot from the different kinds of meetings and people interactions.

For people who are interested, our team built a knowledge base model in a knowledge base engine that our customer developed during his PhD, and an interface on top of it in Python and Lisp that interacts with the knowledge base which achieves some threat detection and access control features. One other team built an app that shows pins on Google Map of past crimes around campus so students can refer to it when choosing where to live in or which route to walk back home. One team built a website that scrapted the CWE vulnerability database, gave the vulnerabilities a more structured categorization and allows different keyword search. One other team built a threat detection devops tool that helps developers to configure their system structure easily and holds the detection process on AWS for them.

## Other Resourses

### 1. ICC

Summer is a great time for attending ICC workshops as there are far less people so everyone can ge more chance to speak and ask questions in a safe and comfortable environment. All the instructors there are very encouraging and supportive. What may even be more encouraging is to know that there are people struggling at the same thing as you are.

I personally find the email for academic purpose workshop very useful. 

### 2. GroupX 

GroupX fitness classes are also amazing. There is a wide range of different workouts, from HIIT to pilates, from Glutes to yoga. Also you benefit more that there are far less students here in the summer. I remember having 1 or 2 private sessions. 

### 3. CPDC

Summer is also a good time to talk to your career advisor and sharpen your resume to get ready for TOC. Sometimes is not about what you learned from the appointments, just talking to your career advisor is a stress reliever and a to get you back in track if you have been laid back for sometime.
