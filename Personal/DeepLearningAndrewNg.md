# Tips For Taking the Deep Learning Coursera Courses
I have taken Andrew Ng's machine learning course on Coursera last year and signed up immediately for his new deep learning specialization (5 courses in total)  after it's out. Andrew Ng is an amazing instructor. 3 things I love the most about this course are:
1. It covers not only concepts like his ML course, but also his experience in practice. Learning the concepts and different models is relatively easy. What is hard is that there are so many choices for models, activation functions, number of hidden units, etc. There is no guidelines for choosing a "best" model. Andrew Ng talked a lot about some choices people will make or thumb of rules during practice and I find this very helpful.
2. The programming homework is very well designed to guide you through implementing the concepts. And Andrew also provides some programming tips in his cours. So it's just very friendly to people who are not very familiar with Python and want to learn what are the better coding practices. 
3. The workload is not heavy. Anyone can squeeze this course into their schedule easily. 

I just finished the first course in this specialization and I got 5 tips for people who are interested in taking it.

## Tip 1 - Take the Quizzes Before Watching Videos
There are 1 or 2 quizzes every week and they are quite easy. So instead of using them as a recap for what we just learned in the video, I find it more helpful to do the quiz before watching any video and get a hint of what will be covered in this week, what you already know and what you don't yet. This also helps to find things you think you know but you actually don't.

## Tip 2 - White-Boarding to Recall 

It's very easy to fall into the illusion that you grasped some models just by watching videos. Besides doing the coding assginments, whiteboarding the algorithms is also very helpful.

## Tip 3 - Buy the Certificate 

I always purchase Coursera certificates. It just gives me more motivation to finish the course and get the trophy. I find myself put much more commitment to the Coursera courses I purchased than other also very good but free courses on other platforms. And linking the certificates to your LinkedIn profile is a very good way to present your self-learning abilities.

Thanks for reading this article! Hope this will be helpful to you. Have fun learning!
