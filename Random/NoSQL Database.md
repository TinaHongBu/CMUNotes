# NoSQL Database

Mismatch between how you store the data & how you want to query the data.

## Key-value

- Don't support transactions
- All you do is retrieving from the key
- Burden passed to the application developers

## Document Centric 

- Indexes -> promote linear lookup
- MongoDB

## Consistency

Data is designed to be distributed in NoSQL

- Eventual/Strong Consistency
- Causal Consistency: Guarantees the order
