## What is Knowledge

Sir John Franklin explored the Artic with 100 men, all of them died because the ship was stuck in the frozen river. And there was not enough men and time for them to learn the knowledge of surviving. 

Success nowadays really depends on how much knowledge one is exposed to.

## Challenges of Quora

- Routing: people to ask/answer

  - Upvote is not very accurate
  - Who upvoted it? "experts"
  - Past answer quality
- Aggregation
- Update outdated info
- Duplication
- Ontology
- Internationalization: Translation
- answers increased exponentially: infrastructure scaling -> also enables new ML stuff
- Quora has a much smaller area to defend against abuse compared to Facebook or Twitter
- UI design
